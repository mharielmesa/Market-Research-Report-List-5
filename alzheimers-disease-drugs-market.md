<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Alzheimer`s Disease Drugs Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Cholinesterase Inhibitors</li><li>NMDA Antagonists</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Alzheimer's disease drugs market includes two primary types: cholinesterase inhibitors and NMDA antagonists. Cholinesterase inhibitors, such as donepezil, rivastigmine, and galantamine, enhance cognitive function by slowing the breakdown of acetylcholine, a neurotransmitter crucial for memory and learning. Conversely, NMDA antagonists, like memantine, regulate glutamate activity to prevent excitotoxicity, a process that can damage neurons. Together, these drug classes aim to alleviate symptoms and improve quality of life for patients with Alzheimer's disease.</p></p>
