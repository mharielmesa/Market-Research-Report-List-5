<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Nickel Plating Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Electroless Nickel Plating</li><li>Electro Nickel Plating</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The nickel plating market comprises two primary types: electroless nickel plating and electro nickel plating. Electroless nickel plating involves a chemical reduction process that deposits nickel uniformly on surfaces without the need for electrical current, offering excellent corrosion resistance and uniform coating thickness. In contrast, electro nickel plating utilizes an electrochemical process, where an electric current facilitates nickel deposition onto a substrate. This method allows for thicker coatings and is often more cost-effective for large-scale applications, each serving distinct industrial needs.</p></p>
