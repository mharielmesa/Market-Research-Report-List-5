<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Hypersonic Missiles Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Hypersonic Ballistic Missiles</li><li>Hypersonic Cruise Missiles</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The hypersonic missiles market is primarily divided into two types: hypersonic ballistic missiles and hypersonic cruise missiles. Hypersonic ballistic missiles travel at speeds greater than Mach 5, following a high-arcing trajectory before re-entering the atmosphere to strike targets, making them hard to intercept. Conversely, hypersonic cruise missiles fly at sustained supersonic speeds and are designed for aggressive maneuverability, allowing them to evade radar and defense systems while executing precision strikes. Both types enhance military capabilities significantly.</p></p>
