<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Wet Dust Control Systems Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Wet Scrubbers</li><li>Wet Electrostatic Precipitators (WEPS)</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Wet dust control systems are designed to reduce airborne particulate matter through moisture-based methods. The two primary types are wet scrubbers, which use liquid to capture dust and pollutants from gas streams by facilitating contact between the gas and the liquid, thus removing contaminants effectively. Wet Electrostatic Precipitators (WEPS) enhance this process by employing an electrostatic charge to attract and collect particles in conjunction with moisture, improving efficiency in industrial environments. Both systems are crucial for achieving cleaner air standards.</p></p>
